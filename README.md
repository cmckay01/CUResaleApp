# CUResale App - Demo 

This repo contains Balsamiq and Figma mockups as well as a video demo of an app I designed with four other classmates in my UI Design Class (COMS W4170) at Columbia University. Please feel free to review the mockups and watch the video demo to see the app in action. Since it is over 50 MB, you have to download it first before you can watch it. 

This app was designed in Swift with various Firebase products such Authentication, Storage, Database, and more. 

If you are a recruiter (or someone who found this repo from my resume), please personally message me to review source code for this project: cjm2302@columbia.edu
